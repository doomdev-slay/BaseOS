# Welcome to probably the most lightweight OS.... It just boots after all..

##### A simple documentation can be viewed below:

### Flash drive install

The core files are not a os image which means you can just copy them with syslinux on your drive.


### Boot with syslinux

You can boot the core-kernel files(some are in the "src" folder) in syslinux outside an OS.
You can use projects default syslinux.cfg or write your own configuration file..  https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Syslinux.
